        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 22, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to TheMove. By downloading, installing, or using the TheMove mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>

        <p>TheMove is a venue discovery and itinerary planning application that helps users find restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues. The App provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences, location, and mood.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. If you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardian's consent to use the App. Features related to bars, nightlife, and alcohol-serving venues are intended for users of legal drinking age in their jurisdiction.</p>

        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>

        <p>Some features of the App may require you to create an account using Apple Sign In or Google Sign In. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. You agree to provide accurate information and to notify us if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.</p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>

        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or other users' accounts</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the App</li>
            <li>Use automated systems or bots to access the App</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App's functionality</li>
            <li>Reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Venue Information</h2>

        <p>Venue information displayed in the App (including hours, ratings, photos, and availability) is sourced from third-party services such as Google Places and may not always be accurate or up to date. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any venue information. Always verify details directly with the venue before visiting.</p>

        <p>The App does not make reservations on your behalf. Reservation links provided within the App direct you to third-party services (such as Resy, Tock, OpenTable, or Yelp), which are governed by their own terms and policies.</p>

        <h2>6. Personalization and Recommendations</h2>

        <p>The App uses your stated preferences and interaction history to generate personalized venue recommendations. These recommendations are algorithmic suggestions and do not constitute endorsements. We are not responsible for your experience at any recommended venue.</p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>The App, including its design, code, features, and content (excluding third-party venue data), is owned by TheMove and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

        <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. We disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, TheMove and its operators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to damages resulting from venue visits, reliance on recommendations, or loss of data.</p>

        <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>

        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless TheMove and its operators from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses arising from your use of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>11. Modifications</h2>

        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes through the App. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Termination</h2>

        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately.</p>

        <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>

        <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
