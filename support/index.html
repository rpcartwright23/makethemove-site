        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <p><strong>How does TheMove learn my taste?</strong></p>
        <p>The Taste Trainer lets you swipe through real venues in your city. Every swipe teaches the app what you love, what you skip, and what you can't stand. Over time, your recommendations get sharper and more personal.</p>

        <p><strong>How do missions work?</strong></p>
        <p>Pick a mood, choose a plan style, and select a neighborhood. TheMove generates a walkable route of curated stops tailored to your preferences and the time of day.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I use TheMove in my city?</strong></p>
        <p>We're currently live in Denver with more cities coming soon. If you'd like to request your city, drop us a line at the email above.</p>

        <p><strong>How do I delete my data?</strong></p>
        <p>Your taste preferences are stored locally on your device. Deleting the app removes this data. If you have an account and would like your account data deleted, email us at <a href="mailto:support@makesthemove.com">support@makesthemove.com</a> and we'll take care of it.</p>
