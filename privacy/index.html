        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 22, 2026</p>

        <p>TheMove ("we," "us," or "our") operates the TheMove mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Location Data.</strong> With your permission, we collect your device's approximate location to show nearby venues and personalize recommendations. Location data is processed on-device and is not stored on our servers.</p>

        <p><strong>Taste Preferences.</strong> When you rate venues through the Taste Trainer or interact with recommendations, we store your preferences locally on your device to improve future suggestions. This data is not transmitted to third parties.</p>

        <p><strong>Usage Data.</strong> We may collect anonymized usage statistics such as feature usage frequency and app performance metrics to improve the App. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

        <p><strong>Authentication Data.</strong> If you sign in with Apple or Google, we receive only the minimal information needed to create your account (such as an anonymized user ID and, optionally, your name and email). We do not access your passwords.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide personalized venue recommendations based on your location and preferences</li>
            <li>To build and refine your taste profile for better suggestions</li>
            <li>To improve and maintain the App's functionality and performance</li>
            <li>To communicate important updates about the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Places API</strong> to retrieve venue information such as names, addresses, photos, ratings, and hours of operation. Your location is sent to Google to find nearby venues. Google's privacy policy applies to data processed by their services.</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase</strong> for backend data storage and user authentication. Data stored in Supabase is protected by row-level security policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple Sign In / Google Sign In</strong> for account authentication.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <p>Your taste preferences and profile data are stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms. Account data (if you sign in) is stored securely in our Supabase backend with row-level security, meaning each user can only access their own data.</p>

        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information, but no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

        <p>Local preference data remains on your device until you delete the App. If you create an account, your account data is retained until you request deletion. You may request deletion of your account data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@makesthemove.com">support@makesthemove.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal data we hold about you</li>
            <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent for location access at any time through your device settings</li>
            <li>Request a copy of your data in a portable format</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy in the App. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
